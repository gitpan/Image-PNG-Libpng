This is the README for Image::PNG::Libpng version 0.24.

Image::PNG::Libpng is a "module" for the Perl computer programming language, a
library of computer code to install on a computer.  This document contains four
sections:

1. About - what the module does

2. Documentation - how to learn more about the module

3. Installation - how to install this module on a computer

4. Help - what to do if you get stuck

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ABOUT

Image::PNG::Libpng - Perl interface to libpng

This is a low-level library for accessing the contents of PNG
graphics. PNG means Portable Network Graphics and it is a common
standard for graphics.

Image::PNG::Libpng enables Perl to use the "libpng" library for
reading and writing files in the PNG format. Image::PNG::Libpng does
not contain "libpng". "libpng" must be installed on the computer prior
to installing Image::PNG::Libpng.

Image::PNG::Libpng consists of Perl subroutines which mirror
the C functions in libpng, plus helper subroutines to make it easier
to read and write PNG data in Perl. 

For those familiar with libpng, to know what the differences between
this module and libpng are, please go to the section "Differences
from libpng". For those not familiar with libpng, the module basically
mirrors the C interface of libpng. An extension of this module,
"Image::PNG", is intended to give a more intuitive interface to the
library.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. DOCUMENTATION

You can read the documentation for the module online at the following websites:

    * http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Image::PNG::Libpng
    * http://metacpan.org/release/Image-PNG-Libpng

(These links go to the latest version of the module.)

After installing the module, you can read the documentation on your computer
using

    perldoc Image::PNG::Libpng

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. INSTALLATION

This module requires Perl version 5.8.1 or later.

To install the module from CPAN, use

    cpan Image::PNG::Libpng

If you have the App::cpanminus installer, you may prefer

    cpanm Image::PNG::Libpng

To install the module from the source file, Image-PNG-Libpng-0.24.tar.gz,
follow this sequence of commands:

    tar xfz Image-PNG-Libpng-0.24.tar.gz
    cd Image-PNG-Libpng-0.24
    perl Makefile.PL
    make

If you want to test the module before installing it, use "make test" after
"make" and before "make install".
